# Ant Colony Optimization for the Traveling Salesman Problem

## ECM3412 - Coursework Exercise

This project contains the implementation of the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with datasets representing city distances in Brazil and Burma.

### Lecturers

### Description
The task is to optimize travel routes for a company operating in multiple cities. The ACO algorithm is implemented to minimize the total cost of traveling between all cities, represented by a distance matrix.

### Algorithm Parameters
The algorithm's parameters include the number of ants, pheromone evaporation rate, pheromone importance factor (alpha), heuristic importance factor (beta), and the number of iterations.

### Experiments
Experiments were conducted by varying one parameter at a time while keeping others constant to observe the impact on the algorithmâ€™s performance. The parameters explored include variations in ACO approach, evaporation rate, colony size, and heuristic functions.
